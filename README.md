## Water Quality Monitoring System

Using AI and high definition camera to measure water safety by detect bacterias and particles in the water source.

The Artificial Intelligence detects contaminated in real time and it works offline.

In this paper, we present a new open-source wireless sensor platform, which allows water quality to be measured at the tap. Our internet-connected devices transmit data back to cloud hosted services, where they can be analyzed in real-time. We provide examples of large-scale deployments within buildings in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA and Mexico City, Mexico. In each of these studies, we demonstrate the detection of phenomena that would have been missed through existing, low-throughput monitoring approaches. The deployment in Ann Arbor emphasizes the importance of real-time measurements in a drinking water distribution system, highlighting shifts in neighborhood-scale electroconductivity (a proxy for total dissolved solids) that would have been missed as part of established sampling procedures.


Water Quality Monitoring (WQM) is a cost-effective and efficient system designed to monitor drinking water quality which makes use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In this paper, the proposed system consists of several sensors to measure various parameters such as pH value, the turbidity in the water, level of water in the tank, temperature and humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. And also, the Microcontroller Unit (MCU) interfaced with these sensors and further processing is performed at Personal Computer (PC). The obtained data is sent to the cloud by using IoT based ThinkSpeak application to monitor the quality of the water.
